Hello Everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. In this blog post, I'll walk you through how to quickly set up a vulnerable Active Directory (AD) environment to practice your pentesting skills. We'll be using a script called [Vulnerable-AD](https://github.com/safebuffer/vulnerable-AD)

Firstly, click on the link below to download the Windows Server 2019 iso file.<br>
[Windows Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019)

Once you have downloaded the ISO file, import it into [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/info/workstation-player/evaluation) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), depending on your preference. After setting up the VM, Click on Start machine.
When the Windows server powers up, right-click Powershell and select Run as administrator. <br>

Visit the [safebuffer](https://github.com/safebuffer/vulnerable-AD) GitHub page, then copy and save the vulnad.ps1 file to a notepad.<br>

If you don’t have an active directory installed on the server, Run the following commands:

{% highlight Powershell %}
Install-windowsfeature AD-domain-services
{% endhighlight %} <br>

{% highlight Powershell %}
Import-Module ADDSDeploymen

Install-ADDSForest -CreateDnsDelegation:$false -DatabasePath "C:\\Windows\\NTDS" -DomainMode "7" -DomainName "prnz.local" -DomainNetbiosName "prnz" -ForestMode "7" -InstallDns:$true -LogPath "C:\\Windows\\NTDS" -NoRebootOnCompletion:$false -SysvolPath "C:\\Windows\\SYSVOL" -Force:$true
{% endhighlight %} <br>

**NOTE: Make sure to change the domain name of your preferred choice. Mine is prnz,local**

This will restart your VM. Now as a final step, Enter the following commands to execute the script.
{% highlight Powershell %}
Import-Module .\vulnad.ps1

Invoke-VulnAD -UsersLimit 100 -DomainName "prnz.local"
{% endhighlight %} <br>

After that, you should see the following output: <br>

That’s it I hope this small blog helps you to get started with setting up a Vulnerable AD environment for pentesting.

*Thank You...*

**Happy Pentesting..!**
