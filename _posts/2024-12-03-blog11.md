Recently, I completed the Authentication module from the Web Application Pentesting learning path on TryHackMe. The module is excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skills in web application pentesting. <!--more-->
Today, I will walk you through a small challenge from TryHackMe called Hammer. The vulnerability in this challenge is bypassing the authentication mechanism and gaining RCE (Remote Code Execution) on the application. The goal is to find two hidden flags. Let’s get started.

Using Rustscan with the following command, I discovered that only two ports were open:
{% highlight bash %}
rustscan -a 10.10.118.103 
{% endhighlight %

A web application was running on port 1337.

I tried common usernames and passwords like admin:admin, admin:password, etc., but nothing worked. By clicking the “Forgot Password” button, it prompted for an email. So, first, we need to find a user.
